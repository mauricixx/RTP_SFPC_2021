# W06_Toolkit Questions

## *(Recreating)*
- What would be 3-5 keywords that capture the visuals? Are there archives, online galleries, exhibitions that published or still publish arts with the same keywords?


    --responsive, interactive, kinetic
    iterative, generative
    
- What is the name of techniques or computer science fields that relate to this visual output?

computer vision - and as cognitive scientist Abeba Birhane has said - it was a mistake (considering its racist uses)

    - facial / computer morphing, human motion recognition, deep learning, gesture recognition
    - augmented reality, virtual reality
    - animation
## 
- Who were the people around the artist? Do they considered themselves part of a movement?
    - TeamLab creates interactive installations too
    - “new media”
## *(Reenacting)*
- What was the medium the artist was using and how does it differ from today’s available medium?
    - Computer vision/ machine learning
    - projection
    - painting
    - photography
    - interactive installations
    - motion capture
## 
- Can you use the same hardware, software, language, technique, process to reenact the artist experience?
    - https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix
    - https://learn.ml5js.org/#/ // p5.js compatible image recognition library
    
## *(Rethinking)*
- Is this artist a pioneer? Why? How? What does that mean? Why does it matter?
    - I think Myrion Krueger is a pioneer in the colonialist sense when he’s claiming property on ideas and creative uses of a technology by constantly reminding people “he was first”
## 
- What was the time period the artist was working in, what was the historic moment they lived in, what society surrounded the artist?
    The works shown were ranging from 1600 to early 2000. There was a progression in showing movement and interactivity using analog processes to more digital and programming based methods.
## *(Reframing)*
- What part of society the artist was representing or actively choosing to not represent? Who was on the other side?
    - For me, early installations of video as installation tech make a pretty discriminatory point about the normative body
    - one thinhg i think is that using artistic forms of experssion that allow us to imagine near or far away liberatory futures (like art that expresses posthuman ideas ) 
    



- What kind of political tensions was the artist involved in? What is today's unfolding of this tension?
    - Surveillance / anti-face recognition / bias in such technologies
    - who gets to create what and what is the power behind technological “advances” to maintain status quo and how we may disrupt this
    - Racial profiling. Nancy Burson’s ‘Human race machine’ allows users to see themselves “with the facial characteristics of six different races” which are the following: Asian, White, African, Middle Eastern, and Indian. This raises a lot of questions in itself but I also see how this is the basis of racial profiling technology used by governments to target and criminalize facial features associated to a racial category. One manifestation of this type of technology is Rekognition which has been used by the US’s ICE to racially profile immigrants coming to the US.
