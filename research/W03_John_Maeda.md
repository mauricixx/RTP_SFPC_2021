“..computers have the capacity to loop through a function or task forever without getting tired. Plus, they log detailed results as they go along. 
So for humans, the takeaway here is to decompose a gnarly problem into smaller components. Are there partial solutions you can try over and over, iterating a little bit each time until you land on the right one? What if you simulate isolating and changing one variable at a time? Seeing the ripple effects helps clarify how all the pieces relate to each other. Mimicking computational thinking can go a long way toward modeling a living system. It opens up an entire universe of possibilities.
