**Anni Albers** (born **Annelise Elsa Frieda Fleischmann**; June 12, 1899 – May 9, 1994)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anni_Albers#cite_note-Who_Was_Who-1) was an American [textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile) artist and [printmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printmaking) credited with blurring the lines between traditional craft and art.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anni_Albers#cite_note-NMWA-2)

Quotes from wikipedia, artist statements, descriptions, etc…

> We do not speak of designing a picture or concerto, but of designing a house, a city, a bowl, a fabric. But surely these can all be, like painting or music, works of art.


> The material is a means of communication. Listening to it, not dominating it, makes us truly active. To be active, be passive.


> Being creative is not the desire to do something, but listening to that which wants to be done.

“The more we avoid standing in the way of the material and in the way of tools and machines, the better chance we have that our work will not be dated, will not bear the stamp of too limited a period of time and be old-fashioned some day…And it will outlast fashions only if it embodies lasting, together with transitory, qualities.”

**Articles**
Articles, magazines, documentaries about the artist

A central tenet of Albers’s artistic philosophy is a Bauhausian commitment to anonymity over individualism. The reasoning behind this was that by denying the presence of the artist to create a ‘form unburdened by dominantly individual traits of the planner,’[4] and not dictated by fashions or trends, universal and timeless beauty could be attained. This is what Albers wanted for her art and design, whether in weaving or print.  ([Source](https://kennethtylercollection.net/2014/04/17/the-prints-of-anni-albers-line-involvements/))
