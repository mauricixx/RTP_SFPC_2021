> The swirling formations of type were likely devised using the “The Rotation System,” which Cooper conceived of as an exercise for the VLW’s influential first course, “Messages and Means.” The technique involved running square sheets of paper through the press four times, rotating the paper and changing the inks with every pass. From time to time Cooper would create typographic compositions in this way—as in her famous [“Message and Means” course poster](https://i0.wp.com/blog.baselinemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/message-and-means-course.jpg)—or use a similar technique on abstract shapes.
