**Biographic data**
Nedim Kufi (also known as Nadem al-Kufi), born 1962 in Baghdad), is an Iraqi-Dutch multi disciplinary visual artist. He is primarily known for conceptual art that explores themes such as war, political conflict, exile, loss, and historical memory. Much of his work contains autobiographical elements. He is also a graphic designer and print maker.

From the heart of Iraq to the heart of Europe, Nedim has lived an extraordinary life of suffering and isolation. Adventures in mixed media-from paper and flowers to earth and terracotta â€“ have helped him create muddy expressions of thought that straddle the disciplines of printing, print making and design. Drawing on the Islamic tradition of repetition and patterning, Kufi is a virtuoso of improvisation and experimentation.
