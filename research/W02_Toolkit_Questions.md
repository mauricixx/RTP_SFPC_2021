# W02_Toolkit Questions

## *(Reenacting)*
- What was the medium the artist was using, and how does it differ from today’s available medium?
    - Film, cardboard, paint, appropriated machines (to become solely a drawing machine)
    - Computers are actually now smaller and faster! And television-sized (if you connect your MBP to 4 displays, including a TV - Tim Cook)
    - Old analog computers used for computing ballistic trajectories. 
    - User interface
    - Accessibility 
    - motors
    - Modern computers are much smaller and faster. They’re also more integrated — you can just export a video instead of taking photos using a film camera.
    - Visual synthesizers / [Vector monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_monitor): “In a vector display, the image is composed of drawn lines rather than a grid of glowing [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel) as in [raster graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics).”
    - Older technology/computers that seem more analog. A combination of technology modern for its time and the human touch. 
    - Combination of visuals/music
    - mechanical analogs
    - Drawing on film 



        lens-based cameras and chemical process film


- Can you use the same hardware, software, language, technique, process to reenact the artist experience? How would you approach this reenactment?
    - Using multiple machines/devices (we have the luxury that everything is embedded into each other) 
    - You can use virtualization to use some of the same software and languages. Technique and process are easier to reenact — probably the hardest part there is learning what their approach was. To reenact their interaction with hardware, I might search secondhand shops or vintage stores. Some computer museums also have working versions of old hardware you’re allowed to play with.
        spirograph, mechanical devices, pendulum (I’d like to learn how to use electronics for this type of visual display)
    - I would look around my house for motorized machines: drills, record players, roombas. or make unmotorized machines.
    - Use code to control hardware (e.g. Arduino), or create patterns to print or apply on analog media (e.g. paper)
    - Creating visual synthesizers similar to audio synthesizers and connecting it to a monitor 
    - Many of the old film-based / cathode-ray type devices used are probably still available but hard to get your hands on. But maybe you could hack an old inkjet printer or use physical film. Or cobble your own thing together with an Arduino/RPi? Program an oscilloscope!
    - There is this device/decorative object in my house with a pendulum and sand - as the Earth rotates it draws the pattern of that rotation in the sand. Well, it would, but it’s lost some sand now and the pendulum doesn’t touch the sand anymore so it doesn’t really draw that pattern. I would consider recreating this digitally.
    - Would also consider pairing visuals with electronic rather than classical music
    - Maybe by using some cameras, lights and perhaps a raspbberry pi to sorta capture what the hardware (cameras, lights) make into data - transfer it to the computer
    - I would draw using only polar coordinates!


- What can the process of reenactment add to your experience?
    - Creating outside of a familiar or known environment, stimulating creativity
    - Hardware skills 
    - Getting to know more possibilities of creative technology / creative machines 
    - Comprehension of the mechanisms 
    - Experiencing the aesthetics/taste of that generation 
    - Understanding the origin of the technical terms : ) 
    - Seeing the patterns/beauty in the day-to-day or seemingly mundane. Revealing the patterns that exist all around us. 
    - Technological limitations => artistic limitations => creative solutions
    - “hands on” experience with non-computational mechanistic tools; experiencing the mechanistic or mathematical drawn from every day interactions
    - Unsticking you from your normal ways of working. Deepening your appreciation for the speed and convenience of modern computers.
    - Helping you understand how constraints can be useful when making art. In modern art, too many options is often a bigger problem than too few.
    - Encourage you to get to know under-explored parts of the artistic space, or parts of the artistic space that aren’t currently popular.
    - Find new ways of working, especially inter-media; making connections between machines and materials that otherwise are not popular
    - integrating Math for STEAM education, visualization of Math concepts, insight into electronic components and their functions, insight into biodesign and physics, demonstrating pattern-making techniques
    - Discovering the beauty in seemingly “lower-tech” machines / approaches
    - I believe/I see old technology as more closer to nature/physical world/physics than today 
    - Experimenting with different textures 
    - seeing mathematical relationships and “perfect” patterns and order within chaotic elements (order within chaos)
    - experiment and use electronics with other gadgets around the house( i.e. cameras, lights) and translate it to data by transferring to the computer sounds exciting ( havent done it before so i dont know how i’ll get there)
