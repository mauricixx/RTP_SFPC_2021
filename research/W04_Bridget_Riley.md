> In 1967 Riley began to use pure colour in her paintings. She adopted a vertical stripe format to act as a neutral structure in which the rhythms of chromatic variation would bring the painting alive. Choosing careful sequences of colours, Riley explores the subtle effects of each upon the next. In Late Morning she was particularly interested in the effects of the warm and cold tones on white. This interaction creates an impression of pale yellow light radiating from the centre of the canvas.

“They should be so complete as to need, and allow of, no further elucidation. The basis of my paintings is this: that in each of them a particular situation is stated. Certain elements within that situation remain constant. Others precipitate the destruction of themselves by themselves. Recurrently, as a result of the cyclic movement of repose, disturbance and repose, the original situation is re-stated.”

“After leaving the Royal College in 1955 Riley returned to Lincolnshire to look after her father who had been seriously injured in a car accident. The problems that had started in Riley’s final years at the Royal College were compounded by her current situation and led to a complete physical and mental breakdown for the artist.”
