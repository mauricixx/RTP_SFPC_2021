## Lillian-Yvonne:

I attemped to do a recreation/inspired by Jack Whitten’s “5 lines 4 Squares”, which I found in a Jack Whitten art book that I happened to have.

I painted beer caps with acrylic paint and the texture was interesting but I’m not so sure about this one

I went with reenacting the process inspired both by Lilian Schwartz and Jack Whitten to experiment between material / analog objects and code.

My idea was to make some kind of poem / prayer with the letters O and H. I wanted to make video art inspired on Lilian Schwartz early video art. I ended up making tons of recordings of different animations but in retrospective they were kind of funny looking so I prefer to make gifs out of the ones I liked.

Here is the code for one of these animations: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1371877

And my giphy profile where you can check out a couple more: https://giphy.com/channel/identikitten

If you’re interested in peeking at the ugly ducklings, let me know! The textures are definitely interesting and worth looking at for future reference on a different piece.
